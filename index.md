## FlowFields, RTS Pathfinding in Unity
## Introduction
The charm of an RTS game is, for many, having control over a high amount of units to strategically defeat the opponent.
Making sure that the player's actions do not get misinterpreted, pathfinding is implemented, which can be very performance heavy for your machine.
To minimize this performance tax while giving a somewhat efficient path to the player's high amount of units, Flowfields can be utilized.

## Less accuracy, more performance
### Modern viability
While Unity is developing a new workflow (ECS/DOTS), which allows for a simpler approach to multi-threading and high performance results, allowing for more accurate pathfinding with a higher amount of units, it is still in a very experimental (nevertheless interesting) state. Consequentially Flowfields is so far still a viable option, giving less accuracy but a lower performance tax.
